# Somnia

Somnia is a mobile-focused web app that uses a highly effective, yet obscure technique called cardiac coherence to help its users fall asleep faster. It works by projecting onto the ceiling a soft blue circle in a sci-fi-esque manner turning the phoneâ€™s display into a projector, that gently expands and contracts, prompting the user to follow it and synchronize their breathing with it. The frequency of breathing slowly decreases from 11RPM to 6RPM at the end of the 8-minute session. Then the app automatically switches off, turning off fullscreen, wake lock and the binaural sleep-inducing music in addition to the projector.
